## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended) or your preferred editor

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/campusconnect.git
cd campusconnect

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### Git Branching Strategy
We use a feature-based branching strategy:

```bash
# Main branch (production-ready code)
main

# Development branch (integration of features)
develop

# Feature branches (individual features)
feature/mentorship-system
feature/events-management
feature/skill-swap
feature/anonymous-chat

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/login-issue
bugfix/api-error

# Hotfix branches (urgent production fixes)
hotfix/security-patch
```

### Creating a Feature Branch
```bash
# Always start from the develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create and switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Example:
git checkout -b feature/mentor-profile-creation
```

### Commit Message Format
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

#### Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add mentor profile creation form"
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication token expiration issue"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation for events endpoint"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for user authentication"
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js Standards
- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Use async/await instead of promises where possible
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Standards
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety (optional but recommended)
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop validation
- Implement error boundaries

### Database Standards
- Use meaningful collection and field names
- Implement proper indexing
- Use MongoDB aggregation for complex queries
- Validate data at the application level

### API Standards
- Use RESTful conventions
- Implement proper HTTP status codes
- Use consistent response formats
- Implement proper error handling
- Add API documentation
